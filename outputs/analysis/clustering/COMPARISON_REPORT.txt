CLUSTERING COMPARISON: k=8 through k=12
================================================================================

INSTRUCTIONS FOR MANUAL SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review each clustering (k=8-12) and select based on:
1. Semantic interpretability - Do cluster labels make sense?
2. Size balance - Are clusters roughly equal or is one huge?
3. RLHF signal - Do delta-enriched clusters align with research?
4. Distinctiveness - Are clusters clearly different from each other?

QUANTITATIVE COMPARISON
================================================================================

   k  | Silhouette | Size Balance | Min Size | Max Size | Largest Cluster
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   8  |   0.0655   |    0.347    |   178    |   515    | Cluster 6 (21.0%)
   9  |   0.0656   |    0.468    |   134    |   514    | Cluster 2 (20.9%)
  10  |   0.0682   |    0.430    |   135    |   494    | Cluster 5 (20.1%)
  11  |   0.0664   |    0.485    |   120    |   487    | Cluster 3 (19.8%)
  12  |   0.0693   |    0.465    |   129    |   446    | Cluster 7 (18.1%)

Metric Definitions:
  - Silhouette: Higher = better separated (but all are low for text)
  - Size Balance: Lower = more balanced cluster sizes (CV of sizes)
  - Largest Cluster: Should be <30% for good balance

RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

Automated suggestions (review manually):

• Most balanced sizes: k=8 (CV=0.347)
• Highest silhouette: k=12 (score=0.0693)

• No dominant clusters (all <25%): k=8 (max 21.0%), k=9 (max 20.9%), k=10 (max 20.1%), k=11 (max 19.8%), k=12 (max 18.1%)


NEXT STEPS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Review clustering_dir/k8/, k9/, k10/, k11/, k12/ subdirectories
2. Read CLUSTERING_ANALYSIS.txt in each subdirectory
3. Check cluster_distribution.png for visual comparison
4. Select the k value that makes most research sense
5. Note your choice and reasoning in research log
6. Proceed with that k value for taxonomy building
